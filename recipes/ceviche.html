    <p>* Ceviche is a healthy dish that is usually served as an appetizer. Its generally made from raw fresh fish or shrimp, thats marinated in lemon and/or lime citrus juices. The acidity in the citrus cures the fish causing it to denature the proteins and become firm and opaque while absorbing flavor.</p>
    <h4>for this example we will use shrimp</h4>
